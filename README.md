# Conformal-Prediction

This repository implements **Conformal Prediction for Classification** applied to deep learning models using PyTorch. The project was developed as a CS115 course project and focuses on uncertainty-aware classification using statistically valid prediction sets.

Conformal Prediction (CP) is a distribution-free framework that wraps around any classifier to produce prediction sets with coverage guarantees, allowing models to express uncertainty instead of returning only a single label.

---

## Project Overview

The project combines:

- A CNN-based image classifier (ResNet18).
- A calibration phase to compute conformal threshold `qhat`.
- A FastAPI backend for real-time prediction.
- Conformal Prediction logic to output prediction sets.
- Optional background removal using `rembg`.

## Conformal Prediction

Conformal Prediction provides a statistically valid way to quantify uncertainty. Instead of outputting only one label, the model outputs a **set of labels** that is guaranteed (with probability ≥ 1 − α) to contain the true label under mild assumptions.

This project uses **Inductive Conformal Prediction (ICP)** with softmax probabilities from a CNN classifier.

## Installation

```bash
git clone https://github.com/TaThanHungbc/Conformal-Prediction
cd Conformal-Prediction
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

---

## Running the Backend

```bash
uvicorn process:app --host 0.0.0.0 --port 8000
```

## Example API Output

```json
{
  "argmax": {
    "label": "Pear",
    "confidence": 0.99
  },
  "conformal_set": [],
  "all_probs": [...],
  "qhat": 0.00007975,
  "threshold_prob": 0.99992025
}
```

- `all_probs` shows the sorted probability distribution.
- `conformal_set` contains labels satisfying the conformal threshold.
- An empty conformal set reflects a highly confident calibration regime, not an implementation error.
